# Air Conditioning Manual for self maintaining

## Section 1: Remote Control Operations

### 1.1 General Remote Control Knowledge
- Remote control proper usage helps cool efficiently and saves electricity
- Remote controls differ by brand and model but share basic functions

### 1.2 Cool Mode
- Function: Releases cool air to reduce room temperature
- Usage: Use with TEMP buttons to increase or decrease temperature

### 1.3 Fan Mode
- Function: Operates the fan to circulate air without cooling
- Usage: Suitable for mild days or when only air circulation is needed

### 1.4 Dry Mode
- Function: Reduces humidity without excessive cooling
- Usage: Ideal during rainy days or high humidity conditions

### 1.5 Auto Mode
- Function: Automatically selects appropriate mode (Cool, Fan, or Dry) and adjusts temperature based on room conditions
- Usage: Convenient for users who prefer minimal manual adjustments

### 1.6 Temperature Adjustment
- Function: Used to increase or decrease desired temperature
- Symbols: Usually + (plus) to increase and - (minus) to decrease temperature

### 1.7 Swing Function
- Function: Controls louver movement to distribute air in different directions
- Usage: Helps distribute cool air throughout the room

### 1.8 Turbo Mode
- Function: Operates at maximum capacity to cool room quickly
- Usage: Ideal when first turning on or when rapid cooling is needed

## Section 2: BTU Calculation

### 2.1 BTU Calculation Formula
- Regular bedrooms: Width (meters) × Length (meters) × 900 = BTU
- Sun-exposed bedrooms: Width (meters) × Length (meters) × 1000 = BTU
- Note: Formula assumes standard floor-to-ceiling height of 2.75 meters

### 2.2 BTU Selection Examples
- Scenario: 3×3 meter room in a two-story house
- Second floor bedroom (typically hotter): Consider 12000 BTU air conditioner
- Ground floor room: May use 9000 BTU air conditioner

## Section 3: Air Conditioner Installation

### 3.1 Installation Overview
- Average time: 1-2 hours (depends on complexity and site conditions)
- Main components: Indoor Unit, Outdoor Unit, copper tubing

### 3.2 Installation Steps

#### 3.2.1 Indoor Unit Installation
- Determine position and mount indoor unit to interior wall
- Install wiring and control panel for indoor unit

#### 3.2.2 Copper Tubing Installation
- Run copper tubes (refrigerant lines) and drain pipe connecting indoor and outdoor unit positions
- Note: Standard copper tube length included with installation is 3-4 meters; additional length may incur extra costs

#### 3.2.3 Outdoor Unit Installation
- Place outdoor unit in suitable position outside building with good air circulation; may use air conditioner stand or mounting brackets
- Connect copper tubes from indoor unit to outdoor unit

#### 3.2.4 Refrigerant System Setup
- Vacuum the system (removing air and moisture from pipes) for clean and efficient operation
- Check for leaks before releasing refrigerant into system

#### 3.2.5 Testing and Handover
- Turn on system to test operation, check cooling, air distribution, remote control functions, and various points to ensure complete normal operation before job handover

## Section 4: Maintenance and Cleaning

### 4.1 Recommended Cleaning Frequency
- Regular residences: Recommended cleaning every 6 months
- Restaurants, hair salons, or locations with dust/smoke/vapor or unusual air conditions: Recommended cleaning every 3-4 months or more frequently as appropriate

### 4.2 Basic DIY Maintenance
- Users can perform basic maintenance by regularly removing and cleaning the air filter to reduce dust accumulation and maintain basic cooling efficiency

## Section 5: Basic Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Air Conditioner Not Cooling

#### 5.1.1 Remote Control Check
- Verify remote control settings: mode (should be Cool), temperature (appropriate or not), and fan speed are correct

#### 5.1.2 Air Output Check
- Place hands in front of both sides of the air conditioner (left-right) to compare cooling; uneven cooling may indicate refrigerant leak or shortage (refrigerant normally circulates in closed system; loss indicates possible leak)

#### 5.1.3 Refrigerant Line Check
- Observe refrigerant line (small pipe at outdoor unit) for ice formation; iced pipes may indicate refrigerant shortage or system problems

#### 5.1.4 Compressor Operation Check
- If air conditioner runs for a while but compressor (outdoor cooling unit) doesn't work (no operating sound or fan not spinning), could be failed compressor (knock) or starter equipment

#### 5.1.5 Control Board Check
- If compressor can be forced to operate (direct connection by skilled technician) and starts immediately, problem may be with compressor control circuit board

### 5.2 Water Dripping Issues

#### 5.2.1 Cleanliness Check
- Check cleanliness of indoor unit, especially air filter and drain pan; excessive dirt may cause water overflow

#### 5.2.2 Ice Formation Check
- Check for ice formation inside evaporator coil or pipes (may be related to refrigerant issues)

#### 5.2.3 Drain Pipe Check
- Check if drain pipe is blocked, has slime buildup, or is kinked, preventing proper water drainage

### 5.3 Air Conditioner Won't Turn On

#### 5.3.1 Remote Control Check
- Check if remote control sends signal properly by using mobile phone camera (photo mode) pointed at remote's IR transmitter; if purple/pink light flashes on phone screen when pressing remote buttons, remote is likely functioning (try changing batteries); if no light, remote may be damaged or batteries dead

#### 5.3.2 Manual Button Check
- Try pressing power button (Manual Start/Stop) directly on indoor unit (usually hidden behind front panel); if unit works, problem is definitely with remote

#### 5.3.3 Electrical System Check
- If pressing button on unit doesn't work and air conditioner breaker hasn't tripped, high chance problem is with unit's internal electrical system or power supply to unit; call qualified technician
